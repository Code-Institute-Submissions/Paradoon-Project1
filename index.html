            Here are three reasons to be on the web:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a>Visibility</a></li>
                <li><a>Cashflow</a></li>

        <p id="p2">You know what they say... What we can't see doesn't exist. 
             Being visible and seeing eachother is a part of being human.
            It's a part of life. The same with a company and a family. 
            Being seen is the most important for our well-being as humans. 
            The same for companies, that's why it's so crucial for survival to be on the web. Nearly half of all google searches are for local businesses.
            That's why it is so important to not only be on the web 
            but also be seen on the web. That's why we help with the SEO (search engine optimization) when building your vision (website).

        <p id="p2">Around 50% of all small businesses have a website in 2020. 
            About 40% of the visitors will not hire or proceed with a company that has a poor website.
            And the percentage of clients who judge a business seriosity by their website is as high as 39%. 
            Did you know that 50% of all potential clients will choose the company with the best and most responsive website over their competitors.
            A company usually generate between 10-30% more revenue by having a website.

        <p id="p2">Mercedes, McDonald's & Windows. <br> When we're reading these company names they will automatically appear as pictures for us. 
            The Mercedes star, the McDonald's Big Mac and the Windows <i class="fa-brands fa-windows fa-xl"></i>.
            Why? - Because it makes us remember more easily. What we remember and know makes us feel safe, 
            and it helps us to make better decisions.
            That's why we would rather buy a Mercedes instead of a car from a company name that we've never heard about. 
            Same goes for your company, with your clients.
