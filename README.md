<ul><h3>Landing logo</h3></ul>
First sight of the site, OurDesign logo combined with three essential reasons to be on the web.

<ul><h3>Three reasons</h3></ul>
First section includes three reasons to be on the web with more ingoing explanation for each reason (visibility, cashflow & trust).

![three](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33704515/179427969-2f841fb1-179f-45f0-9f54-5b4a9cfcfa22.jpg)

<ul><h3>Carving into stone...</h3></ul>
Second section includes images of old stone carving combined with text. Using a metaphor of stone carving to explain todays web. "The place where we go for rememebering and gathering information." Also have an clickable image saying "Let's carve!" to navigate to the "Packages page".

Packages is the second page which shows the different packages available for the entrepreneur or business to choose from. Goes from Silver- to Exclusive-package depending on the needs of the customer.

<h2>Features left to implement</h2>
<ul><h3>Sign up form</h3></ul>
Sign up form on the "About us" page to let anyone apply for a position to work at OurDesign. 

<h2>Testing</h2>
I have run through the website several times, not only for testing but also for learning HTML and CSS. I've made every mistake that's possible which have helped me both to learn and also to test at the same time. The easiest way to put it, is that this website is built by 95% mistakes, bugs and testing and 5% success. Everything from adding images and resizing them, to displaying blocks and inline blocks with images and text to changing all colors to hex for faster loading. 

<h3>Validator testing</h3>
<li>HTML</li>
No errors.
<li>CSS</li>
No errors with CSS level 3 + SVG.
<h3>Unfixed bugs</h3>
Due to the time spent with this project, I think there are none. I also changed layout/design several times if something didn't work or wasn't in line with my own vision. 


<h2>Deployment</h2>
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
<li>In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab</li>
<li>From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch</li>
<li>Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.</li>

<h2>Own notes</h2>
I wish I had the information upon starting this project about making the mobile version first and then using media query to make it work for computers for faster loading. Instead the other way around since I will probably use this website for my own company.
